# MyClaw

Personal AI assistant runtime. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process with skill-based channel provider system. Built-in providers (Telegram, Slack) are registered through `apps/core/src/channels/register-builtins.ts`; additional providers can be added through skills. Messages route to the Claude Agent SDK via host runtime processes. Each group has isolated filesystem and memory boundaries.

## Secrets / Credentials / Proxy (OneCLI)

API keys, secret keys, OAuth tokens, and auth credentials are managed by the OneCLI gateway and runtime environment controls. Run `onecli --help`.

## Skills

Four types of skills exist in MyClaw. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full taxonomy and guidelines.

- **Feature skills** — merge a `skill/*` branch to add capabilities (e.g. `/add-telegram`, `/add-slack`)
- **Utility skills** — ship code files alongside SKILL.md (e.g. `/claw`)
- **Operational skills** — instruction-only workflows, always on `main` (e.g. `/setup`, `/debug`)
- **Custom skills** — managed under `~/myclaw/.claude/skills/` as the single source of truth

| Skill            | When to Use                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/commands`      | List all available slash commands with descriptions             |
| `/setup`         | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration  |
| `/customize`     | Adding channels, integrations, changing behavior                |
| `/debug`         | Runtime issues, logs, troubleshooting                           |
| `/update-myclaw` | Bring upstream MyClaw updates into a customized install         |
| `/init-onecli`   | Install OneCLI Agent Vault and migrate `.env` credentials to it |

## Contributing

Before creating a PR, adding a skill, or preparing any contribution, you MUST read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). It covers accepted change types, the four skill types and their guidelines, SKILL.md format rules, PR requirements, and the pre-submission checklist (searching for existing PRs/issues, testing, description format).

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
```

Service management:

```bash
myclaw service install
myclaw service start
myclaw service stop
myclaw service restart
myclaw status
```

## Troubleshooting

**Channel skill missing after upgrade:** Channels ship as skills, not built-in core modules. Install the relevant skill and then rebuild with `npm run build`.

## gstack

Use the `/browse` skill from gstack for all web browsing. Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

Available gstack skills: `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation`, `/design-shotgun`, `/design-html`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/canary`, `/benchmark`, `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/setup-browser-cookies`, `/setup-deploy`, `/retro`, `/investigate`, `/document-release`, `/codex`, `/cso`, `/autoplan`, `/plan-devex-review`, `/devex-review`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/gstack-upgrade`, `/learn`.

## Agent Runner Build Cache

If you add or update the agent runner, rebuild from the repo root with `npm run build` so `apps/core/src/runner` and emitted dist artifacts stay in sync.
