"""forge stage — per-task execution tracker (.factory/stages.json).

The recorded decomposition is immutable evidence; this file is the mutable
execution state derived from it (one stage per leaf task, list order =
execution order). The loop per stage (WORKFLOW.md "Stage Loop", decision
0007): implement via /codex:rescue → inspect the diff → validate assumption
rows → smallest checks → LOCAL autoreview until clean → commit →
`forge stage done`. `pr_ready` refuses while any stage is not done. Task-
