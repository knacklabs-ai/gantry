# Codex Architecture Harness

The Codex harness enforces the target MyClaw architecture before large source refactors land. It is intentionally stricter than the current codebase; existing debt is recorded in capped exceptions so new work cannot expand it silently.

## Run The Check

Use either command:

```bash
npm run check:architecture
python3 .codex/scripts/check_architecture.py
```

The full deterministic verify gate also runs the architecture check:

```bash
python3 .codex/scripts/verify.py
```

## What It Checks

The checker reads `.codex/architecture-map.json` and validates:

- forbidden imports by layer
- forbidden external/provider imports by layer
- provider-specific code outside approved adapter paths
- direct risky execution outside the sandbox adapter
- default browser profile paths
- files above the configured line budget
- empty source folders without a purpose
- wrapper-only files
- old architecture terms in production source
- active documentation links

## Exceptions

Exceptions live in `.codex/architecture-exceptions.json` as a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "path/to/file.ts",
    "rule": "rule-name",
    "reason": "why temporary",
    "removeByPhase": "phase name or number"
  }
]
```

Counted rules should include a cap:

- `maxViolations` for import, provider, execution, and browser-path rules
- `maxOccurrences` for old-term rules
- `max_lines` for file line-budget rules

The cap is deliberate. If a file already has five violations and a change adds a sixth, the check fails even though an exception exists.

## Removing Exceptions

Remove an exception in the same change that removes or moves the violation. The checker fails stale file-size exceptions when a file comes back under budget, and it fails stale counted exceptions when the rule no longer sees the baseline violation.

Do not raise a cap as routine maintenance. If a cap must increase, the PR should explain why the cleanup cannot happen in that phase.

## Updating The Map

Update `.codex/architecture-map.json` when:

- a new top-level layer or package is added
- a directory changes architectural ownership
- a new adapter family becomes approved
- a new provider SDK or channel SDK is introduced
- the line-budget policy changes

The map should describe the desired architecture, not the current debt. Existing mismatches belong in `.codex/architecture-exceptions.json`.
