# Autonomous Jobs

Autonomous jobs are runtime state, not desired-state configuration. Recurring,
one-time, and manually triggered scheduler jobs are stored in Postgres and must
not be written to `settings.yaml`.

## Capability Policy

At execution time, a job resolves its target agent from the runtime target:
`group_scope` plus `execution_context` (`conversationJid`, optional `threadId`,
optional `sessionId`). The job inherits that target agent's currently selected
tool bindings for the run.

Job-scoped extra tool rules are persisted in `jobs.target_json` under:

```json
{
  "capabilityPolicy": {
    "allowedTools": [
      "Bash(dedup-append-lead.py *)",
      "Read(/Users/me/project/notes.md)",
      "mcp__agent_browser__*"
    ]
  }
}
```

Missing `capabilityPolicy.allowedTools` means an empty extra-tool list.
These rules are stored on the job only. They are never mirrored into
`settings.yaml`; inherited agent grants are resolved dynamically from the target
agent and shown separately.

Allowed job tool rules support exact tool names, registered scoped SDK tool
rules such as `Tool(scope-pattern)`, and `mcp__server__*`. Scoped rules are
evaluated by `apps/core/src/shared/tool-rule-matcher.ts`; new tools must be
registered there with allow/deny tests before they can be used in scheduled job
policy. Empty rules, global `*`, unregistered scoped tools, and other wildcard
forms are invalid. Jobs cannot add admin-only MyClaw tools as extras unless the
originating agent has the selected capability and the originating conversation
approval policy allows it.

## Execution

Scheduled job execution keeps protected capability and memory guards active
before autonomous allowance. It must not write permission IPC or wait for chat
approval during execution. If a tool is outside the effective job allowlist, the
runner denies it immediately with:

```text
Tool not on autonomous job allowlist: Bash.
Recovery: scheduler_grant_tool { "job_id": "job-1", "rule": "Bash(git status --short)" }
```

If a safe scoped `Bash(<command>)` rule cannot represent the requested command,
fallback to broad `Bash` should require manual review.

The scheduler records the failure summary, emits `job.tool_denied`, and notifies
the linked group/thread or DM unless the job is silent.

Host-owned job scripts are not supported. Raw host Bash is not equivalent to
Claude SDK Bash because it does not inherit the SDK filesystem sandbox,
provider tool lifecycle, or per-tool permission callback. Move job logic into
the scheduled prompt and grant exact SDK tools with `scheduler_grant_tool`. Any
future script-like job runner must first provide the same protected-path
deny-write boundary on macOS, Linux, and Docker deployments.

`scheduler_grant_tool` is the agent-facing recovery path for job-local tools.
It reads the current job, appends one rule if absent, and writes the updated
`target_json.capabilityPolicy.allowedTools` through the normal scheduler update
IPC path after validating the rule. It is not a settings-owned persistent agent
grant.

## Visibility

Jobs are inspectable through chat scheduler tools, Control API, SDK, and CLI.
List/detail output should include the target, schedule, status, model, prompt,
`executionContext`, `notificationRoutes`, and one canonical `toolAccess`
object:

```json
{
  "toolAccess": {
    "inheritedAgentTools": ["Read", "Bash(git status *)"],
    "jobExtraTools": ["mcp__agent_browser__*"],
    "effectiveAllowedTools": [
      "Read",
      "Bash(git status *)",
      "mcp__agent_browser__*"
    ],
    "source": "inherited agent grants plus target_json.capabilityPolicy.allowedTools"
  }
}
```

Normal agent-facing scheduler MCP tools are not an admin surface. They may list,
read, mutate, inspect runs/events, inspect dead letters, and manually queue runs
only for jobs whose `group_scope` equals the calling agent group and whose
`execution_context.conversationJid` matches the originating conversation.
Threads/topics remain delivery metadata for notifications and spoof checks: a
thread id may be checked to prevent a caller from retargeting delivery outside
the authenticated thread, but it never grants job visibility or run authority.

Admin-wide job visibility and triggering remain on the Control API, SDK, and
local/admin CLI surfaces.
