# Bombay Sweet Shop — Customer Care Knowledge Base

This skill is the source-of-truth for policy, store, and product-care answers
that Boondi gives without going to Shopify. Fill in the bracketed sections with
content from BSS before going live.

## Gifting & business-interest cues (detecting queries and leads)

Bombay Sweet Shop sells sweets (mithai), namkeen/savouries, chocolates, and
gift boxes/hampers — for personal treats, personal gifts, and bulk/corporate
gifting. Use these cues to recognise commercial intent and capture it silently
(see CLAUDE.md "Capturing business interest"):

- **Shopping / product intent** — specific items (Kaju Katli, ladoo, barfi,
  bhujia, chocolate, hampers, gift boxes) or "what do you recommend", "something
  sweet/savoury". A self-treat or single gift is a light query.
- **Gifting intent** — "gift", "gifting", "hamper", "for my friend / family /
  team / clients", or an occasion (Diwali, wedding, Raksha Bandhan, Eid,
  anniversary, birthday, corporate). Always worth a query.
- **The five gifting questions** — ask the ones you still need together in ONE
  message as a short numbered list of points (a warm checklist, not a form, not a
  paragraph; never re-ask what's known): 1) Occasion · 2) Quantity · 3) Budget
  (per gift or total) · 4) Delivery location(s) · 5) Timeline (+ branding when
  relevant). Each answer you learn fills a capture field.
- **Self-serve boundary** — personal gifting under ~25 pieces: guide them to
  order on the website, but still capture it as a query (a human can upsell).
- **Promote a query to a lead** when intent is decided/strong, or on any
  strong-B2B signal: 25+ pieces · total budget over ~₹10k · corporate email
  domain · multi-city / pan-India delivery · timeline under a week.
- **Buyer read** — personal, wedding/event, small business, employee gifting, or
  client/VIP/procurement. Corporate email + multiple cities + larger quantity are
  the strongest, highest-priority signals.

Seasonal peaks with more gifting/bulk intent: Diwali, wedding season, Raksha
Bandhan, Holi, Eid, New Year, and corporate year-end.
