/**
 * Boondi (Bombay Sweet Shop) guardrail policy — an AGENT-OWNED plugin.
 *
 * This is Boondi's content/logic, loaded by Gantry core at runtime from this
 * agent's folder (see policy-registry.loadAgentGuardrailPolicy). It is NOT part
 * of Gantry core. Gantry core provides only the generic guardrail mechanism;
 * the deterministic patterns, classifier prompt, and customer-facing copy below
 * are Boondi-specific and live here.
 *
 * Self-contained by design: the types are declared locally so the plugin has no
 * import dependency on Gantry's source layout. Core validates the exported
 * shape structurally at load time. When Gantry ships as an npm package, these
 * types can instead be imported from it.
 *
 * Loaded via tsx in dev (.ts, breakpoints bind) and as prebuilt .js in prod.
